//    Structural Design Pattern
//    that simplifies access to a complex subsystem by providing a unified, high-level interface.

//    multiple articles clearly differentiate the Facade pattern from the
//    Adapter pattern, explaining that the Facade focuses on simplicity
//    for a complex system, while the
//    Adapter aims for interoperability between incompatible interfaces.


//    by providing a unified, simplified interface to a complex set of classes, systems, or subsystems,
//     effectively hiding the intricate details and operational complexities from the client code
